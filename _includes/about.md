## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm <span>{{site.firstname}} <span class="text-muted bold">{{site.secondname}}</span>

NYC-based Roboticist working on Machine Learning + Computer Vision and Robotics.

- Interested in [Augmented and Extented Reality (AR/XR)], [Self-Driving] (Pereption, SLAM and Control), [3D Reconstruction] - Structure-from-Motion, Photogrammetry, Neural Rendering & NeRF, Gaussian Splatting, [Distributed ML], [ML Inference]
- Exploring - [LLMs], [VLMs], [AI Agents], [Embodied AI] and [Robot Learning] (Imitation Learning, Behaviour Cloning, Vision-Language-Action Models, Reinforcement Learning)

I hold a MS in Electrical Engineering from [New York University (NYU)](https://nyu.edu) and a B.Eng (Honors) Electrical Engineering from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in).

Always eager to learn new things. Always open to discussions and collaboration. Feel free to reach out to me via: [LinkedIn][linkedin], [Email][email] or [X/Twitter (Open DMs)][x]
