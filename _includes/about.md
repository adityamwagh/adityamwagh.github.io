I'm a Research Software Engineer based out of the United States. I hold a MS in Electrical Engineering from [New York University (NYU)](https://nyu.edu]) and a B.Eng (Honors) Electrical Engineering from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in).

I primarily work on applying machine learning to problems in 3D computer vision and robotics. I like using cutting edge research to build great products. Some things that interest me:

- **Augmented and Extended Reality (AR/XR)**
- **Autonomous Driving:** Perception, Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
- **3D Reconstruction:**: Structure-from-Motion, Photogrammetry, Neural Rendering techniques like NeRF, Gaussian Splatting
- **ML Inference Optimization:** GPGPU, CUDA Kernels, Triton Kernels

**Currently Exploring:** LLMs, VLMs, Diffusion Models, AI Agents, Embodied AI and Robot Learning, specifically, Imitation Learning, Behaviour Cloning, Vision-Language-Action Models, Reinforcement Learning
