I'm a Research Engineer working on Machine Learning + 3D Computer Vision and Robotics.

This is the list of problems I:
- <ins>Have (and can) work(ed) on:</ins> Visual SLAM, Visual-Inertial Odometry, Point Cloud Registration, Semantic Segmentation, 3D Object Detection, Machine Learning Inference
- <ins>Want to work on:</ins> LLMs/VLMs + Robot Manipulation/Navigation (a.k.a VLAs), Language-Grounded Semantic SLAM, Robot Learning in general.

And this is the list of domains I find exciting:
- Augmented and Extended Reality
- Multi-Modal Autonomous Robots - Perception, Localization, Mapping
- General Purpose Robots - Humanoids, Mobile and Fixed Manipulators 
- AI Agents (for example - coding agents like Claude Code)
