ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm Aditya, a **Computer Vision Engineer & Researcher** at the [AI4CE Lab](ttps://ai4ce.github.io/) at New York University headed by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng).  

I am interested in multimodal **perception, localization & mapping algorithms** for autonomous systems.

I received my MS from **New York University** and BEng at **BITS Pilani**, both in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Robotics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

In my free time, I watch science fiction, cook delicious food and contribute to open-source projects!
