ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I'm Aditya, a **Computer Vision Engineer & Researcher** in the [AI4CE Lab](ttps://ai4ce.github.io/) headed by [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng).  

I am interested in multimodal **perception, localization & mapping algorithms** for autonomous systems.

I received my MS from **New York University** and BEng at **BITS Pilani**, both in Electrical Engineering, with a specialization in Robotics, AI and Computer Vision.

During my undergrad, I worked with [Dr. Sumeet Saurav](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/sumeet-saurav/) in the Intelligent Systems Research Group at [CEERI, Pilani](https://www.ceeri.res.in/), a prominent federal research institute.

In my free time, I watch science fiction, cook delicious food and contribute to open-source projects! To get a better insight on my work, have a look at my [ðŸ“ƒResume](/resume.html)
