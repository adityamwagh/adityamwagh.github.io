# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm {{site.firstname}} {{site.secondname}}
{: .fw-bold}

I'm a Research Engineer working on Machine Learning + 3D Computer Vision and Robotics.

Following is the list of problems I:
- <ins>Have worked on:</ins> Visual SLAM, Visual-Inertial Odometry, Point Cloud Registration, Semantic Segmentation, 3D Object Detection, Machine Learning Inference
- <ins>Want to work on:</ins> LLMs/VLMs + Robot Manipulation/Navigation (a.k.a VLAs), Language-Grounded Semantic SLAM, Robot Learning in general.

And this is the list of domains I find exciting:
- Augmented and Extended Reality
- Multi-Modal Autonomous Robots - Perception, Localization, Mapping
- General Purpose Robots - Humanoids, Mobile and Fixed Manipulators, 
- AI Agents (for example - coding agents like Claude Code)

I hold a MS in Electrical Engineering from [New York University (NYU)](https://nyu.edu) and a B.Eng (Honors) Electrical Engineering from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in).

Always eager to learn new things, discuss and collaborate. Feel free to reach out to me via: [LinkedIn][linkedin], [Email][email] or [X/Twitter (Open DMs)][x]
